            <h1>Building a computer?</h1>
            <p>Bulding a computer is no easy task. There are many things you <strong>MUST</strong> know before you attempt to build your first computer.
            The most imporant parts in a computer are the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and RAM. The motherboard is what every part in your computer connects to.
            The motherboard also transfers power to specific parts that are not connected to the powersupply directly.</p>
            
            <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
            <p>The CPU interprits data stored in its internal memory and the RAM. It sends the data to specific parts of the computer
                based on what the data is. For example if the data is something your monitor should process to display on the screen it will send the data to the
                display port. Think of the CPU as the operations manager of a company. As problems come in the operation manager decides who should take care of it.
            </p>
            
            <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
            <p>RAM is extra memory for the CPU. Once the CPU fills its internal memory, which is much smaller than the RAM. The memory needs to be stored somewhere
                else. The speed of the RAM is based on its latency and the clock speed of the memory. You will see a number like 3200MHz which is the speed the RAM
                can store and send data. The latency (CAS) is the number of clock cycles (time) it takes for it to get data after the CPU calls it. Another thing to
                consider when buying RAM is that the more data is can store (EX 8GB) the higher change data can be missed when being looked for. Read more about this
                by googling: "Cache misses".
            </p>
            
            <h2>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>
            <p>Not all computers have GPU's but GPU's are critical when dealing with high resolution graphic enviorments. The GPU coupled with programming languages
                designed for it allow graphic data to be stored, read, and put on your screen infinitly faster than the CPU ever could. The main companants that
                allow the GPU to handle graphics so much better are; A lot more memory, faster memory, and a lot more space for compantants required to maintain
                that memory. There is a constant battle for faster memory, memory size, and cooling the memory. If GPU's weren't cooled and didn't have a failsafe
                to shut off at too high of a temperature it would <strong>MELT ITSELF!</strong>
